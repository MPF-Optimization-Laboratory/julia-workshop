This workshop series is intended for beginners to intermediate users of Julia, but who have at least comfortable with other programming languages. While intended for applied mathematicians, the focus of this workshop series is on the _rationale_ of Julia rather than any particular application. The workshop is divided into five days, which are roughly two hours long:

1. Introductions: installing Julia; an introduction to Julia; touching on its types.
2. Multiple dispatch: covering multiple dispatch; iteration; interfaces.
3. Types and performance: more on Julia's type system and how it allows Julia to be a high performance language
4. Benchmarking; packages
5. Debugging; designing programs; macros

The notebooks are intended for use using the excellent [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([JupyterLab 4 version](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise)).
